## Google Clone

I have developed this Google Clone using:

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6, mediaQueries and a jQuery plugin.

You can try to open this clone with a real Google tab next to it, I tried to make it as similar as possible. Some fonts and images were really hard to apply in the same way, but I did my best. You can also try to click everywhere, almost everything will work.
  
I hope you like it.
